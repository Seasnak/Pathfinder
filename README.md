Pathfinder
GUI Application that computes a shortest path from a grid using various pathfinding algorithms
Users then draw walls on a grid, and the algorithm will find the shortest path in real-time, showing users how it is performed.
Tiles can also be given a "height" to simulate weights between two adjacent tiles.
Pathfinding Algorithms that are used:
-A*
-Dijkstra's
-Bellman Ford's
-Floyd-Warshall's
